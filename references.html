Furthermore, he provided help during the event with the smooth running of the visual support for the TEDx talks.

From my first meeting with Jeremy, he oozed a warm friendly, curious energy that made it really easy to connect with him. He is really enthusiastic and radiates that. He was always encouraging and was fun to work with, offering insightful feedback along the way. He showed himself as a leader through his rare ability to remain totally calm, no matter what is going around him and he totally uses to his advantage to lead others.
